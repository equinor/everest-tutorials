Drogon Reservoir Model
======================


Drogon is a synthetic reservoir model developed and maintained by Equinor. It includes a complete `FMU (Fast Model Update)
<https://github.com/equinor/fmu>`_ set-up. 

The input cases are available in the repository `fmu-drogon <https://github.com/equinor/fmu-drogon>`_ and the output files are available in the repository `fmu-drogon-flow-files <https://github.com/equinor/fmu-drogon-flow-files>`_. This tutorial uses the outputs files with a slightly modified version of the model, with minor changes to the drainage strategy.
